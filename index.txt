## testimonials

Testimonials

alt = Elaine MacDonald
Elaine MacDonald - CEO, Knowledge Impact Network
I have hired both undergraduate and graduate school students with marketing majors to work at KIN, and Anastasiya has been my strongest intern. She is facile with all forms of digital communication (social media, web, email campaigns). Most importantly, she exhibited independent, critical thinking, applying judgement and context to decisions on when and what to publish. She took initiative with creating organizing frameworks for our communications and introduced new digital tools for our organization to leverage. She understood the need for different campaigns targeted at different audiences and was able to tailor messaging appropriately. Given my personal background as a former brand marketing leader at a major consumer packaged goods firm and strategic marketing consultant, my endorsement of Anastasiya’s skills does not come lightly.

alt = Daniela la Foresta
Daniela la Foresta – Professor, University of Naples Federico II
Despite her busy schedule, Anastasiya has always kept a proactive and positive attitude, especially when working on group projects with her colleagues. Observing her ability to create a friendly environment in the team, encourage all members to speak up, and compromise, I realized just how remarkable of a leader she was. It is no wonder that her final group project turned out to be one of the best ever produced by the students of the *International Marketing* course.

alt = Conor Huynh
Conor Huynh - Operations Coordinator, Feedback Labs
Despite the time zone difference, Anastasiya was able to work remotely and meet all of her deadlines independently, showing strong time management and organizational skills. She also showed a great level of comfort working in English with the Feedback Labs team as well as with external partners in the domestic and international environment. Aside from her professional contributions to the team, she also offered fun discussion prompts at team meetings and thoughtful questions in response to others’ projects. I’m confident that the excellent work ethic Anastasiya has demonstrated during the course of her internship will carry over to future career opportunities.

alt = Hanna Fedorova
Hanna Fedorova – Senior Lecturer, Karazin Kharkiv National University
 In all her years at V. N. Karazin Kharkiv National University, Anastasiya’s never had a single grade below A (or Ukrainian 90/100), and the courses I taught weren’t an exception. Last semester, Anastasiya obtained a 100/100 in my International Communications module, owing to her critical thinking abilities. The analytical nature of the course required students to produce academic papers weekly, researching various theoretical and practical aspects of international communications and proposing ways to apply them to solve international political, societal, and business problems. Anastasiya’s creative approach to writing her works demonstrated her in-depth knowledge of the fundamental principles and current trends in both international communications and international relations, as well as a thorough understanding of their interconnectedness in today’s globalized world.

alt = Vladyslav Dementiev
Vladyslav Dementiev – President, Young Agents of Change                
Anastasiia distinguished herself by the ability to efficiently work in a team on group project and enrich the work of the organization. Thus Anastasiia was a diligent and well-organized intern, who demonstrated comprehensive preparation and always completed assignments in a timely manner with positive outcomes. She gained a solid understanding of civil society operation in Ukraine and experience in conducting activities aimed at strengthening civic engagement.
